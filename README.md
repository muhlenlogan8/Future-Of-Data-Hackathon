# Future of Data Hackthon YMCA Volunteer Portal

## Project Overview
Our project involves a user-focused website that allows potential volunteers to find volunteer opportunities nearby based upon their interests and availability. 
This solution will increase the ease with which potential volunteers can find opportunities, which aims to increase the amount of people who choose to volunteer in their communities

## Project Technology
We used React and Tailwindcss for the frontend and Python (Flask) for the backend. We connected our backend to the VolunteerMatters API to pull YMCA Volunteer opportunities.

## How to setup and run
1. Clone this repository onto your computer
2. In the project folder, cd into the frontend folder and run npm i then npm run dev (This runs the React frontend)
3. Open a new terminal, cd into the backend folder and run python app.py (This runs the Flask backend)
4. Then go to http://localhost:5173/ and enjoy the application!

## Next Steps
We would love to contineu building out this project. Due to the time constraint there are many features we'd like to continue work on such as...
1. Pull volunteer data and display metrics on the admin dashboard
2. Allow users to actually sign up for volunteer opportunities
3. Improve the recommendation algorithm for better opportunity recommendation
