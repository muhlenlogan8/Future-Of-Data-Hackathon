# Future-Of-Data-Hackathon

## Personalized Volunteer Recommendations System

This project is a hackathon submission for the Future of Data competition, focusing on creating an intelligent volunteer matching platform that connects users with volunteer opportunities based on their interests, skills, availability, and preferences.

## Project Overview

The system aims to solve the problem of volunteer-opportunity mismatch by using data-driven approaches to:
- Collect comprehensive user profiles including interests, skills, and preferences
- Implement sophisticated matching algorithms that consider multiple factors
- Provide personalized recommendations that evolve based on user feedback
- Create an intuitive interface for discovering and engaging with volunteer opportunities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with Vite build system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.13
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7.8.2
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, SWC compiler for fast refresh

## Key Features (Planned)

### User Profile Collection
- Multi-step onboarding process
- Comprehensive interest and skill mapping
- Availability and preference settings
- Values-based questionnaire system

### Recommendation Engine
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm considering:
  - Cause alignment (30% weight)
  - Skills match (25% weight)  
  - Location proximity (20% weight)
  - Schedule compatibility (15% weight)
  - Commitment level match (10% weight)
- Machine learning feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Diversity boost to introduce users to new opportunities

### User Experience
- Personalized dashboard with top matches
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Social features for team volunteering
- Impact tracking and progress visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Future-Of-Data-Hackathon
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

In the frontend directory:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## Development Status

This is an active hackathon project currently in development phase. The current implementation includes:
- âœ… Basic React application setup
- âœ… Comprehensive system architecture planning
- âœ… Detailed recommendation algorithm specifications
- ðŸš§ UI/UX implementation (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Backend API development (planned)
- ðŸš§ Database integration (planned)

## Algorithm Design

The recommendation system uses a sophisticated scoring mechanism that evaluates volunteer opportunities based on:

1. **Cause Alignment**: Matches user's preferred cause categories
2. **Skills Compatibility**: Aligns required skills with user offerings
3. **Geographic Proximity**: Considers distance and transportation preferences
4. **Schedule Matching**: Compares availability windows
5. **Commitment Level**: Matches short-term vs long-term preferences

The system also incorporates diversity factors to prevent echo chambers and encourage skill development.

## Data Privacy & Ethics

- Minimal PII collection approach
- Secure storage of user preferences
- Transparent algorithmic decision-making
- User control over data and recommendations

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with existing volunteer databases
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Social networking features
- Skill development tracking
- Impact measurement dashboard
- API integrations with calendar systems
